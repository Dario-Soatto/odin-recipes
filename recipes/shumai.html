    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>
        We'll be mincing and preparing:

        Pork shoulder butt: (8 oz)

        Cut into slices, strips, then into fine bits. Soak in water and massage the pork for 1 to 2 minutes. Let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Afterward, drain in a colander and squeeze out as much water as you can.

        Shrimp: (4 oz)

        Wrap in a paper towel and squeeze out as much moisture as you can. Mince into fine bits.

        Dried shiitake mushrooms (4 pieces)â€‹:

        Reconstitute in hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. Then, squeeze out as much water as you can. Slice the mushroom in half, lengthwise. Cut into strips, then mince into fine bits.

        Carrot (0.50 oz):

        Cut into slices, strips, then very fine bits.

    <p>
        In a bowl, we'll mix:

        light soy sauce (1 tbsp)
        oyster sauce (2 tbsp)
        salt (0.50 tsp)
        sugar (2 tsp)
        cornstarch (2 tbsp)
        baking soda (0.50 tsp)
        chicken bouillon (1 tsp)
        water (2 tbsp)
        white pepper (0.50 tsp)
    </p>

    <p>
        We'll be creating our siu mai fillings in a few steps:

        Mix the sauce and pork in a bowl for about 2 to 3 minutes. This is important in helping the pork become more tender.
        Let the pork absorb the sauce for about 10 minutes.
        Then, add in the minced shrimp and mushrooms, along with olive oil (1 tsp) and sesame oil (1 tbsp). Mix again for another 1 to 2 minutes.
        Cover with plastic wrap, and let everything marinate in the refrigerator for 4 to 8 hours.

        Lay out a wrapper in your palm (my dad prefers his left/non-dominant hand).
        Scoop about 1 oz of meat filling onto the wrapper, and loosely flatten it.
        Make a circle by pressing your index finger and thumb together, and place the wrapper over the circle. Make a funnel-like shape with your other fingers.
        With the opposite end of a spoon, push into the center of the wrapper, into the hole you made with your fingers.
        Compress the meat into the dumpling wrapper by pressing with your spoon, squeezing with your fingers on all sides. Rotate the dumpling with your fingers a few times.
        Squeeze the bottom half of the dumpling to force some of the meat to rise, and flatten that with your spoon.
        If there's not enough meat, you can add some more and repeat.
