    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb glutinous rice (also known as "sticky rice")</li>
        <li>24 oz water</li>
        <li>8  lotus leaves</li>
        <li>8  salted egg (will be using just the yolk)</li>
        <li>2  Chinese sausage</li>
        <li>6 oz chicken drumstick meat</li>
        <li>4 oz char siu</li>
        <li>12 pieces dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>6  red shallot</li>
        <li>8 oz water (for cooking the filling)</li>
        <li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>4 tsp water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>
        Pour some warm water into a large bowl or pot and submerge the lotus leaves for 2 hours. You can keep them submerged by putting a heavy bowl on top of the leaves.

        Each leaf can be used to wrap 2 Lo Mai Gais. Make sure to clean and check the leaves once they are done soaking.

        Cut the leaves into quarters and the hard center of the leave off. Set them aside for assembly.

    <p>
        Wash the rice (2 lb) at least three times.

        Many people soak the rice for a few hours before steaming but Daddy Lau chooses to cook it right after washing because it's easier.

        Once washed, and optionally soaked, add the rice into the rice cooker with water (24 oz) and level the rice for even cooking.

        When the rice is cooked, loosen the rice so then it will be easier for the sauce to penetrate it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bring a pot of water to a boil and place the salted eggs into the water to cook for 2 minutes. Once cooked, place the eggs into a bowl of cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
        Peel off the chicken skin from the drumsticks (6 oz) with a paper towel. Then, start deboning it by cutting the meat lengthwise along the bone to expose it.

        Carefully break the bone closer to the ankle or the "handle" of the drumstick. Pull the meat away from the rest of the bone and cut the remaining bone that is connected to the meat off. Cut away any stringy tendons.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have dried shiitake mushrooms (12 pieces), rehydrate them in warm water for 10-15 minutes before cutting them. Make sure to save the water for later!

        Once rehydrated, select your mushrooms (12 pieces) for the different styles of cutting- minced  (6 pieces)and thickly (6 pieces) sliced. Cut your mushrooms accordingly and set aside.

        Cut the Chinese sausage and char siu (4 oz) into 8 pieces.

        Cut the ends of the shallot off, peel, and smash them before mincing it and setting it aside.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, we'll start stir-frying our ingredients. We'll set our stove on high heat, and let the wok heat up for 2-3 minutes.

        The oil is hot enough when it starts rippling and smoking as we spread it around the wok.

        When the oil has heated up, turn the heat off and add the chicken. Cook the chicken for 30 seconds with the heat off, and then set the stove back to high heat.

        Let the shallots cook for about 15-30 seconds. Then add mushrooms and water (8 oz).

        we'll stir the wok around for about 45-60 seconds. Then, we'll set the heat to low, and start adding our sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
        Add oyster sauce (2 tbsp), light soy sauce (2 tbsp), tamari (1 tsp), chicken bouillon (4 tsp), sugar (4 tsp), and salt (1 tsp).

        Turn the heat off and mix cornstarch (2 tsp) with water (2 tsp) until it becomes a slurry. Set the heat to high, add the slurry while stirring constantly, and gradually turn it down as the sauce thickens.

        Cook it for about 2-3 minutes longer. Once the slurry comes together, add in sesame oil (4 tsp), then put the filling onto a plate to cool down. Turn the stove off.

        Use a wide dish so that you can spread the filling out to cool down faster.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once cool to the touch, peel the eggs and let them completely cool before gently peeling the egg whites off to expose the egg yolks.

        Cut the egg yolks in half and set them aside for assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take the mushroom juice left over from soaking the dried shiitake mushrooms and combine it in a small bowl with water (6 oz), oyster sauce (1 tbsp), light soy sauce (2 tsp), and oil (2 tsp). This sauce will help the glutinous rice to loosen and make it easier for us to wrap the lo mai gai.

        Once combined, pour it over the rice, mix, and transfer onto a plate to cool down. It doesn't have to be completely cold, but it'll be easier to handle if it's not piping hot.

        While the rice is on the plate, use the rice paddle or a spatula to roughly portion your rice into the number of Lo Mai Gai you're making.
    </p>

        Now it's time to fill the lotus leaves. Set up your station by having all the ingredients within reach.

        First, take two quarters of lotus leaves and place them one on top of the other having the wider parts of the leaves overlapping each other and the narrow ends are at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock.

        Take a portion of rice and flatten it by hand. Make sure to make the center a bit more thin to hold the filling in place. Place the rice onto the center of the lotus leaves.

        Spread a tablespoon full of the chicken and mushroom filling over the rice.

        Place the Chinese sausage, char siu, and salted egg yolk on top of the filling.

        Make another flatten portion of rice to place on top of the filling. Make sure to have the filling not spill out around the rice.

        Tightly fold the lotus leaves around the rice starting with the sides at 3 and 9 o'clock and the at 12 and 6 o'clock.

        Repeat this process 7 more times.

        If you notice any cracks or rips in the lotus leaf, you can cut another leaf to place on top of the rip to cover it.

        Pour water into the steamer and place the steamer on the highest heat. When the water is boiling, it's time to load up the steamer with the lo mai gai!

        Place the lo mai gai seam down onto the steamer's tray. Arrange them into a single layer. Do not stack them as they will not cook properly.

        Steam for 20 minutes on high heat.
